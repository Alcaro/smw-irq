Documentation style:

1) Tabs are the method of spacing with a width of 8.
2) \n is the preferred line ending for consistency.
3) Labels and code should never share a line.
4) Underscores are the naming convention of choice.  Case variations are not permitted.
5) Prefer sublabels whenever possible.
6) A newline may be added after jumps/subroutines/forced branches/or branches into other subroutines.
7) The "soft margin" width is 120 characters per line. 
8) Lines missing an address should have the address added.
9) At this time RAM defines should NOT be used.
10) Abbreviations should be avoided where possible to enforce maximum consistency.
11) Opcode suffixes are currently required.  At some point they will be removed however.
12) Avoid +/- labels if reasonable.
13) Opcodes and hex numbers are written in upper case.
14) Documentation should be enough to at a mimium explain the result of an operation, rather than the operation itself.
15) All labels should recieve meaningful names, code/data labels should be gradually removed.
